Text normalization is the process of transforming text into a standard or normalized format, typically to improve the quality and consistency of text-to-speech (TTS) systems.
In the context of converting written text to spoken form, text normalization involves handling various aspects such as expanding abbreviations, resolving acronyms, converting numbers and symbols into spoken words, handling punctuation, and adapting the text to match natural language patterns and prosody.
Here are some common techniques used in text normalization:
Abbreviation Expansion: Text normalization involves expanding abbreviations and converting them into their full forms. For example, "Mr." could be expanded to "Mister," or "Dr." to "Doctor."
Acronym Resolution: Acronyms are often converted into their spoken equivalents. For instance, "NASA" could be pronounced as "N-A-S-A" or "National Aeronautics and Space Administration" depending on the context.
Number Conversion: Text normalization involves converting numeric values into their spoken form. For example, "123" might be pronounced as "one hundred twenty-three."
Symbol Handling: Symbols like punctuation marks or special characters are typically omitted or converted into appropriate verbal cues. For instance, "!" could be pronounced as "exclamation mark" or simply as "bang."
Capitalization Handling: Capitalized words are often normalized to match spoken language patterns. For example, "USA" might be pronounced as "U-S-A" or "United States of America" depending on the context.
Emphasis and Prosody: Text normalization can add prosodic information, such as emphasis or intonation, to enhance the naturalness and expressiveness of the spoken output. This involves analyzing the structure and context of the text to determine appropriate stress patterns and intonation.
Text normalization is an important step in the development of high-quality TTS systems. It helps ensure that the spoken output sounds natural, intelligible, and conforms to the expectations of the target language or dialect."""},

Text normalization is an important step in natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as speech synthesis, voice assistants, and other applications that involve converting written text into spoken words.
    The goal of text normalization is to transform written text, which often includes abbreviations, acronyms, symbols, and other non-standard forms, into a more standardized and phonetically correct spoken form. This process helps ensure that the synthesized speech sounds natural and is easily understandable to human listeners.
    Text normalization involves several subtasks, including:
    1. Expansion of abbreviations and acronyms: Abbreviations and acronyms are expanded into their full forms. For example, "NLP" might be expanded to "natural language processing."
    2. Number normalization: Numeric expressions are converted into their spoken form. For example, "123" might be converted to "one hundred twenty-three."
    3. Symbol handling: Special symbols, punctuation marks, and other non-alphanumeric characters are processed appropriately. For example, "3.14" might be converted to "three point one four."
    4. Date and time normalization: Dates and times are converted into spoken form, adhering to the appropriate formats. For example, "2023-05-31" might be converted to "May 31, 2023."
    5. Phonemic conversion: Words or phrases that are written in a non-standard form but are pronounced differently are converted into their phonetically correct spoken form. For example, "wanna" might be converted to "want to."
    Text normalization can be achieved using various techniques, including rule-based methods, statistical models, and machine learning approaches. These methods rely on linguistic resources, such as dictionaries, language models, and phonetic representations, to accurately convert written text into spoken form.
    It's worth noting that text normalization can be a challenging task due to the inherent ambiguity and variability of written language. Different regions, dialects, and languages may require specific normalization rules and adaptations to accurately convert text to spoken form."""},

            1. PLAIN: Represents plain words or phrases that do not require any special normalization. These are typically regular words found in the text.
            2. DATE: Represents expressions related to dates, such as "May the thirty-first, twenty twenty three" or "May 31, 2023."
            3. LETTERS: Represents sequences of letters, often used for alphabetic characters or words.
            4. CARDINAL: Represents cardinal numbers, such as "123" or "one hundred twenty-three."
            5. VERBATIM: Represents words or phrases that should be read exactly as they are written, without any modifications or normalizations.
            6. DECIMAL: Represents decimal numbers, such as "3.14" or "three point one four."
            7. MEASURE: Represents expressions related to measurements, such as "ten centimeters" or "5 kilograms."
            8. MONEY: Represents expressions related to currency or monetary values, such as "$10" or "five euros."
            9. ORDINAL: Represents ordinal numbers, such as "1st," "2nd," or "third."
            10. TIME: Represents expressions related to time, such as "2:30 p.m." or "twelve PM."
            11. ELECTRONIC: Represents electronic-related expressions, such as URLs, email addresses, or usernames.
            12. DIGIT: Represents individual digits, typically used for numerical digits in isolation.
            13. FRACTION: Represents fractions, such as "1/2" or "three-fourths."
            14. TELEPHONE: Represents telephone numbers, such as "555-123-4567" or "five four five three two one two three four five."
            15. ADDRESS: Represents address-related expressions, such as street addresses or postal codes.
            16. PUNCT: Represents punctuation marks, such as commas, periods, or question marks.
            These types help categorize and handle different forms of text in the normalization process, enabling more accurate and consistent conversion of written text into spoken form."""},
